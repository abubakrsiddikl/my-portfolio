        Hi, I’m <span className="text-[#F0C268] font-bold">Abu Bakr Siddik</span>, a passionate junior web developer. I enjoy
        creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications, combining
        creativity with functionality. I have hands-on experience with various
        technologies, including <span className="text-[#F0C268] font-bold">HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React, basic
        Node.js, and Express.js, MongoDB</span>. I am always eager to learn new tools and
        frameworks, aiming to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful
        projects. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new trends in
        technology and finding ways to solve real-world problems through
        innovation.
